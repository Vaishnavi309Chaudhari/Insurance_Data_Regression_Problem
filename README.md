## Introduction
Insurance cost prediction is an important task for insurance companies to determine the premium for individuals based on their personal information and health data. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the insurance cost based on the following features: age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about individuals such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and the corresponding insurance cost.

## Features
The features in the dataset are:
- `age`: Age of the individual.
- `sex`: Gender of the individual (male/female).
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index, providing an understanding of whether the individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
- `children`: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
- `smoker`: Smoking status of the individual (yes/no).
- `region`: The individual's residential area (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest).
- `charges`: Insurance cost (target variable).
